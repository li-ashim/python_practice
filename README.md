# python_practice
A bunch of scripts I wrote during learning features of Python.

Most file names don't match snake_case and 
some scripts don't provide comments about their purposes. It is kind of shame :(

Anyway, here is list of features covered:
* Classes
* Functional programming
* Decorators
* Context managers
* Iterables, iterators and generators
* Descriptors

Also there are my attempts to implement some built-in things
